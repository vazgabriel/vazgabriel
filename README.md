### Hi there 👋

I have been working as a software engineer since 2017. I love programming, designing systems, databases, etc. Recently I have specialized in Frontend development.

I love using React and Typescript (and all the tools that come with it), I have also worked with Angular in the frontend, and Node.js, Python, Java, etc in the backend. I have worked with monoliths and distributed systems (microservices and microfrontends), and with SQL and NoSQL databases.
