### Hi there 👋

I'm a full stack developer with more than 3 years of experience, passionate about programming and technology. I like to design and architect systems and databases.

My favorite stack is Javascript, using React, React Native, Node.js, Angular, Ionic, etc. I also like to work with databases SQL and NoSQL (as PostgreSQL and MongoDB), and I'm entering in the Blockchain world using [EOSIO](https://eos.io/) and C++.

Besides it, I also worked with Python (Flask), PHP (Code Igniter, Laravel), and Firebase tools. I also studied a lot about Flutter, Swift, Golang, Elixir (with Phoenix), but I still didn't use them professionally.

- 💻 I’m currently working at [Belatrix Software](https://www.belatrixsf.com/), a [Globant](https://www.globant.com/) division

- 📕 I’m looking to collaborate on sharing knowledge at [Comunidade Código pra Todos (Brazilian Community)](http://comunidade.codigopratodos.com/)
